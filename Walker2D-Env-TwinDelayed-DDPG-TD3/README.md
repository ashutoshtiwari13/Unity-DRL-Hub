## Walker 2D Environment using Twin-Delayed DDPG (TD3)

### Environment  
Solving the environment require an average total reward of over 2500 over 100 consecutive episodes.  
The __Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)__ algorithm is introduced in the basic paper [Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09477).
